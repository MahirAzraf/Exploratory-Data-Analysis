This is a project where I took a wikipedia url of largest companies of canada. Then i imported important libraries and started web scraping. As there were three tables in the wiki, so I had to scrap the important table and then clean teh data and find out if there were any missing data and then use preprocessing and visualize them and gain insights on which company is the largest and how much revenue they have etc. You can learn more by seeing the code
